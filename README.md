# HACK K8s Charms

This is a script to aid in development of the kubernetes charms. The primary
concerns currently reside in the kubernetes repository.

kubeapi-load-balancer
kubernetes-master
kubernetes-worker

But there are several middle layers, interfaces, and related projects that
need to be cloned in order to *really* hack on the source and assemble locally.

This repository is an attempt to aid in that setup, so everyone has a consistent
source tree, we use the same remotes when discussing issues, making prs, etc.
and that we can generally get spun up very quickly from scratch.

Contributions welcome!
